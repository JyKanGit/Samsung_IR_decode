# Samsung IR remote decoding on ATmega328 in Arduino Uno

Similar in functionality as the main branch but running on Arduino Uno and uses different pins and timers. Useful for debugging as functions such as `Serial.print` can be used.

IR sensor pin = PB0, Arduino pin 8 <br />
LED pin = PB3, Arduino pin 11

## Running

Copy everything from `main.c` and paste in the Arduino IDE and upload the code.
